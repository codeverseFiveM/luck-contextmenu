You can add priority for options, if you want at top of menu options you should give smallest number of menu.

### Both right, left clickable example.
```
{
						label = v.label,
						event = "e " .. v.action,
						icon = "fa-solid fa-face-smile",
						type = "animation",
						subOptions = {
							{
								label = "Remove Animation",
								icon = "fa-solid fa-trash",
								action = function()
									for i = 1, #animations do
										if animations[i].action == v.action then
											table.remove(animations, i)
											break
										end
									end

									TriggerServerEvent('luck-contextmenu:SetFastActions', animations, "animations")

									AddFastActions(animations, commands)
								end
							}
						}
					}
```
